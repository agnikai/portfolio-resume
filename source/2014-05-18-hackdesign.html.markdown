					<p>A great course for interactive design. There are over 40 different lessons all focused on design topics. Each features articles and key sites for bookmarking. They cover a range of topics about how today current in today's design world. You can choose to skip ahead or follow the lessons in order, or choose a specific topic from the main page to focus on such as Typography, which will take you through all typography focused lessons. Once you make an free account with them it then sends you e-mails each week with your next lesson. You can choose to do multiple lessons in a week's time and then the next week's email reflects your status on lesson's completed and forwards you lesson links accordingly. They are constantly updating and adding new material, so it's a great course to sign up for and keep up with new design techniques.</p>
