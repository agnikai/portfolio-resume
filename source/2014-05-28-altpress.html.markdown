				<p class="about">The original design for this site, was that instead of being fully responsive from desktop to mobile, was that the mobile view would be a separate entity called TAP-mobile made using middleman and angular.js. Several problems arose when trying to configure the angular so the Rails Dog team ended up discarding of the angular completely and changing the site over to a Rails framework instead.</p>
