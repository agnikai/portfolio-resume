				<p class="about">I became involved in this project through MFRW Design, a company run by a friend, Thomas Sample, who, by the time I came on board, had already aquired Ideal Furniture Outlet as a client and had an active contract. The most imporant features were that it be a fully functional e-commerce site, have a admin console for entering products and regulating orders, and also that it was fully responsive.</p>

<!-- <p>I became involved in this project through MFRW Design, a company run by a friend, Thomas Sample, who, by the time I came on board, had already aquired Ideal Furniture Outlet as a client and had an active contract. The most imporant features were that it be a fully functional e-commerce site, have a admin console for entering products and regulating orders, and also that it was fully responsive.</p>

<p>The main platforms for building the project were Ruby on Rails, Spree (an impressive e-commerce framework), and Bootstrap 3. Coming into this project I have a good working knowledge of HTML and CSS and have gotten my feet wet with Javascript, JQuery, and Ruby. However when it came to Rails, and particularly Spree, I had little to no knowledge of how they work and interact with one another.</p>

<p>My part in this project was mainly on frontend and design. The first thing I was able to focus on learning was Bootstrap, which as I quickly learned was extremely useful in creating responsive websites.</p> -->
