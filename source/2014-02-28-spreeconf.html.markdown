				<h1 class="courses">SpreeConf 2014</h1>
				<p>I used Spree when assisting on the frontend for the iDeal Furniture Outlet E-commerce website. The Spree Conference conveniently overlapped the building of this site and was thus extremely useful. There were many different subjects covered by the speakers. A great amount of tech was explained in detail, such as navigation and creation of plugins. Some other great topics was the idea of storytelling through your Spree site, making the customer feel like they are being guided through a selection of items with purpose so as to increase the sales and general site activity. The speakers were inspiring and captivating and I hope to get the chance to attend the next conference.</p>
				<p>Some of the talks given were (descriptions were taken from the conference websites):</p>
