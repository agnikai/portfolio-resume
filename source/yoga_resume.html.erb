				<p>An amazing studio owned by an inspiring friend of mine, Sukha is not only where I have taken many yoga classes, it's also the place where I was introduced to Aerial Arts, and where I recieved my 200 hour certification. And, of course, is where I teach mat yoga, aerial yoga, and aerial dance classes.</p>

				<p>In addition to teaching classes with mulitple students in public studios, I have also had the opportunity to work closely with one student who, due to scheduling or confidence, are unable to practice with a group. Practicing one-on-one gives me a chance to really focus on individual goals and needs and gain a deep understanding of yoga's ability to help heal and grow.</p>
