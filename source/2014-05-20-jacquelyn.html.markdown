				<h2 class="about">About This Site</h2>
				<p class="about">This site was made using Middleman Blogging which sets up a framework for blogging sites and allows you to generate new blog articles and display them based on most recent, or order them by date and tag. Middleman makes the process of routing, generating static pages, creating dynamic urls, and asset pipelines easy. For styling, I used Twitter Bootstrap 3, which enables a whole world of easy stylistic changes possible just by adding class names to your elements. I used it for the grid system, the dropdown menu seen on the mobile version of my header, adding responsivity to images and text, and improving the overall general look of the site.</p>

<!-- 				<p class="about">In reading about design, I have learned that website design is verys similar to the famous saying by Coco Chanel, "before leaving the house, a lady should look in the mirror and remove one accessory." Great UI/UX Design stems from the ability to make everything as simple as possible. Simplicity is key, cluttering the page only distracts from the content. Learnability is key - the client should be able to look at the site and be able to navigate it successfully with little to no time spent in interacting and examining it. All of these things being considered, I would like to stress the fact that well I learning these ideas, this site may not be the best example of such design insite. I myself am an overdecorated person, often feeling too ambitious and pulled in many directions. I used this site as a way to learn different methods of styling and building, and thus is it a large compilation of many different themes I have been learning how to implement.</p>
				<p>Languages used to make this site were HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, and Javascipt. The full list of tools includes, Middleman Blogging Framework, Twitter Bootstrap 3, LICEcap for making gifs, Photoshop for editing, and JQuery Plugins, specifically Magnific Popup for lightboxes.</p>
